# Backdoor AI - Open Source
This version is not the same as our private one. We’ve made changes to keep our code safe. But if you’re worried, it’s fine. You can use this free version.<br>
<br>
To start using our free version, find the file named ‘bookmarklet.js’ and set it up as a bookmark, or run it through the inspect element tool.<br>
<br>
While this open-source UI gives you access to our tools, you might find it less appealing visually. If you’re interested in a smoother and more attractive experience, we recommend using our official version at backdoor.best.
